# ethos protocol

The basic idea is to be able to put funds into a bounty pool and distribute to a group of people
that **collectively** work towards a goal.

At the end of the campaign—or in intervals, if it’s an open ended campaign—their success will be
evaluated by **verifiers**. If the project is successful, the funds will be distributed among the
collective of impact creators.

**Verifiers** will also be rewarded for their contributions out of the bounty pool.
